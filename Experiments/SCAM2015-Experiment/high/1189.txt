Loop master string
for every character (using index i, lets say)
   check whether this is same as first character of the other string
   if it is
      //potential match
      loop through the characters in the child string (lets say using index j)

      match them with the consecutive characters in the master string 
      (something like master[j+i] == sub[j])

       If everything match, 'i' is what you want
       otherwise, continue with the master, hoping you find a match
