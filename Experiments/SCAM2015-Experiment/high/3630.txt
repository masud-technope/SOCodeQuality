// step 1
// flowerInVase is greater than 7, so the first thing to do is call the function again! 
// Note that the System.out.println is NOT yet reached because of the execution of the function!
// call emptyVse(7 - 1), the *stack* has *remembered* to the current value of *floweInVase* => 7
emptyVase(7); 
// step 2
emptyVase(6);
// condition is *true* yet again, so the same rules as above apply
// current *remembered* value of `floweInVase` is 6
// step 3
emptyVase(5);
// and so on ... until `flowerInVase` is 0 ... now ...
