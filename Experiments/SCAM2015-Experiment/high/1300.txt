for each character ch in the string:
    Write character ch to position (row, col).
    If (row + dRow, col + dCol) is not contained in the rectangle [0, 0] x [n-1, n-1]
             -or-
       The character at [row + dRow, col + dCol] is not zero:
        Rotate 90 degrees

   // Move forward a step
   row += dRow
   col += dCol
