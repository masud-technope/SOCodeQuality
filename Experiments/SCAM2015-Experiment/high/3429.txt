// Assuming this class extends Class1, and it is public, you 
// can create an instance of this class from outside the package:
ExtendedClass1 e = new ExtendedClass1(); 

// This is using the public constructor that expects a Class1.
// Although Class1 itself is NOT public, this constructor 
// can be called with an instance of a (public) class that
// extends Class1
Class2 c = new Class2(e);
