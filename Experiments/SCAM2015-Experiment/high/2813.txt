Given a compile-time reference type S (source) and a compile-time reference 
type T (target), a casting conversion exists from S to T if no compile-time 
errors occur due to the following rules.
[...]
If S is an array type SC[], that is, an array of components of type SC: 
[...] 
  - If T is an array type TC[], that is, an array of components of type TC, 
    then a compile-time error occurs unless one of the following is true: 
    - TC and SC are the same primitive type. 
    - [...]
