/*
Medium Speed
Air 1100 feet per second
Water 4900 feet per second
Steel 16,400 feet per second

Write a program that asks the user to enter "air", "water", or "steel", and the distance that a sound wave will
travel in the medium. The program should then display the amount of time it will take.
You can calculate the amount of time it takes sound to travel in air with the following formula:

Time = Distance / 1100
You can calculate the amount of time it takes sound to travel in water with the following formula:

Time = Distance / 4900
You can calculate the amount of time it takes sound to travel in steel with the following formula:

Time = Distance / 16400
