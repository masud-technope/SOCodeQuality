double x = 11.45; // number inputted

String s = String.valueOf(x); // String value of the number inputted
int index = s.indexOf("."); // find where the decimal is located

int amount = (int)x; // intialize it to be the number inputted, in case its an int

if (amount != x) // if the number inputted isn't an int (contains decimal)
    // multiply it by 10 ^ (the number of digits after the decimal place)
    amount = (int)(x * Math.pow(10,(s.length() - 1 - index)));

System.out.print(amount); // output is 1145

// if x was 11.4500, the output is 1145 as well
// if x was 114500, the output is 114500
