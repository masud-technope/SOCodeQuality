When the intern method is invoked, if the pool already contains a
string equal to this <code>String</code> object as determined by
the {@link #equals(Object)} method, then the string from the pool is
returned. Otherwise, this <code>String</code> object is added to the
pool and a reference to this <code>String</code> object is returned.
