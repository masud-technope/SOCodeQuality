1) Import the java.util.List package.

2)  another error I find is this.. How don't know your requirement Cannot suggest the solution.

public MyAbstractClass(List<? extends Animal> animalList) {
        this.myAnimalList = animalList; <==== problem you cannot assign List<? extends Animal> to List<Animal> .. Subtyping is not allowed in generic class.
    }
