//This would work..Test it like this first
String f=" SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='adam villiam'";
//but if you type adam villiam and press enter 
//to asign it to a variable via Scanner.next() 
//only villiam would be saved in the variable.
//you expect (adam villiam)
username="adam villiam";
//but result would be (only villiam)
username="villiam"
//so if you do it like this it will not return as expected,
String f=" SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='"+username+"'";
//because this clause mean to be like this(only villiam)
String f=" SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='villiam'";
