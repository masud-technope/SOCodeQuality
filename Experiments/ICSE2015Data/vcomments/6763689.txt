Thanks for this code, it worked very well. One wrinkle for other users: you will need to explicitly call setMaxLines(int) rather than just setting the property in XML.
Actually, it should be very trivial to map out these variables to XML attributes via attrs.xml.
i found a problem if workingText is Chinese. because Chinese doesn't have SPACE, so this code works not perfectlyï¼Œ i have modified some code below, hope will help.
Adding the following into the constructor will allow you to set the maxlines via XML:
TypedArray a = context.obtainStyledAttributes(attrs, new int[] { android.R.attr.maxLines }); setMaxLines(a.getInt(0, 2));
This screws up all the non-string attributes that the TextViews CharSequence holds. For example give the TextView a Spannable with bold text, and the bold is not shown.
I created an Android library with this component and changed it to be able to show as many lines of text as possible and ellipsize the last one; see https://github.com/triposo/barone
