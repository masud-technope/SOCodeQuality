You can even use.  "moveTaskToBack(true);"
great stuff works prefect!
will it dealocate all the resources? Because when I exit the app this way and after some time I click the app icon again. It starts from where I left it. That means the app was still running in the background.
Activity.finish();
This keeps your app in the background, so it does not exit the application.
This answer will just make the home screen appear and will not exit/close the application completely as the OP wants.
