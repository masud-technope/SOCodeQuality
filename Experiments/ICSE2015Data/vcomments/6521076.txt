@Kostanos As [getResources()](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getResources()) is a an abstract method on the Context class, you can't  use it without a Context. If you're in an Activity you can just call `getResources()`; if you're in a view, you can use `getContext().getResources()`. If neither of these work for you and you don't want to pass in a Context, see [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16277011/getresources-from-static-method-without-context) for an alternative solution. Hope that helps!
