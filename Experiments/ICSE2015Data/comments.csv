Every desktop browser does this when you're using your scroll wheel.  Android itself can handle nested scrolling if you're navigating via the trackball, so why not via touch?"

"6343299","40791505","0","For people questioning @AndroidDev. Please see [Order Of Execution](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html). As you can see, from Honeycomb, tasks are performed serially. This means that if you have a long running AsyncTask, then attempt to do something trivial, the trivial task will wait until the long running task is complete. This is no reason to avoid it though! You can solve this with the supplied solution: ""If you truly want parallel execution, you can invoke executeOnExecutor(java.util.concurrent.Executor, Object[]) with THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR."""
