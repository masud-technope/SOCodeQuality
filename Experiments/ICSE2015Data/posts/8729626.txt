<p>However, the app will be forced to close sometime, you can fix it by adding android:configChanges attribute into main activity in Manifest file like as: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity android:name="".MainActivity""
                  android:label=""@string/app_name"" android:configChanges=""keyboardHidden|orientation"" &gt;
</code></pre>
