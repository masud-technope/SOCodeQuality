<p>that's not true. /mnt/sdcard/external_sd can exist even if the SD card is not mounted. your application will crash when you try to write to /mnt/sdcard/external_sd when it's not mounted.</p>

<p>you need to check if the SD card is mounted first using:</p>

<pre><code>boolean isSDPresent = Environment.getExternalStorageState().equals(Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED);
</code></pre>
