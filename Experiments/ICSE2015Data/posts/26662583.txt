<p>I was having a similar problem and finally got it to work. My scroll view contains a series of customized buttons, followed by an <code>EditText</code> (which normally has focus, but I don't want it to be losing focus). Any time the buttons were clicked, the scroll view auto-scrolled to the focused <code>EditText</code>.  Overriding <code>public boolean requestChildRectangleOnScreen(final View child, final Rect rectangle, final boolean immediate)</code> and always returning <code>false</code> (default behavior of a <code>ViewGroup</code>) did the trick. Hope it helps with your situation too.</p>
