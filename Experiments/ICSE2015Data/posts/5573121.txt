<p>It may not answer your question, but it could be useful to know (I was looking for it myself when I came to this question) that if you need a View's dimension but your code is being executed when its layout has not been laid out yet (for example in <code>onCreate()</code> ) you can setup a <code>ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener</code> with <code>View.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener()</code> and put the relevant code that needs the view's dimension there. The listener's callback will be called when the layout will have been laid out.</p>
