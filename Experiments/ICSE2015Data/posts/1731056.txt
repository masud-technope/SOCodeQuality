<p>thanks for your help but I am afraid it still doesnt work. 
if i add the line you suggested, it underlines ""getItemAtPosition"" and says: 
--The method getItemAtPosition(int) is undefined for the type View--</p>

<p>He suggests to cast the view to a AdapterView, so it looks the following:</p>

<pre><code>String s = ((TextView) ((AdapterView&lt;ListAdapter&gt;) view).getItemAtPosition(info.position)).getText();
</code></pre>

<p>When i run this and make a long click on the item, i recieve an ""ClassCastException""</p>
