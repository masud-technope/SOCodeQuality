<p>From PictureDrawable to Bitmap, use: </p>

<pre><code>private Bitmap pictureDrawableToBitmap(PictureDrawable pictureDrawable){ 
    Bitmap bmp = Bitmap.createBitmap(pictureDrawable.getIntrinsicWidth(), pictureDrawable.getIntrinsicHeight(), Config.ARGB_8888); 
    Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bmp); 
    canvas.drawPicture(pictureDrawable.getPicture()); 
    return bmp; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>... implemented as such: </p>

<pre><code>Bitmap bmp = pictureDrawableToBitmap((PictureDrawable) drawable);
</code></pre>
