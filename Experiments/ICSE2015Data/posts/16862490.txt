<p>The only solution I have found for this scenario is to create 2 layouts.  One is editable and one is not.  You may have to create more than 2 layouts based on various conditions.  Store the conditions in SharedPreferences or other means and load the relevant layout based on conditions after restarting the Activity.  Here's an example:</p>

<p>in onCreate() of the activity:</p>

<pre><code>    configuration = new Configuration(this.getSharedPreferences(Configuration.SHARED_PREFERENCES_FILE_NAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE));
    manualSettingsMode = configuration.isManualSettingsMode();
    if(manualSettingsMode){
        setContentView(R.layout.editableconfigurationsettings);
    }else {
        setContentView(R.layout.configurationsettings);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The activity can be restarted based on testing for condition and calling functions as:</p>

<pre><code>private void setManualEditing(){
    configuration.set_isManualSettingsMode(true);
    this.recreate();
}

private void setAutoEditing(){
    configuration.set_isManualSettingsMode(false);
    this.recreate();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.  There really has to be a better solution, but this is what I've been doing.  Ideally, one would be able to do this on individual fields and not have to reload the activity / layouts. -bobby</p>
