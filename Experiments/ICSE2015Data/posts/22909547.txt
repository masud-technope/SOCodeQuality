<p>Further to @Kevins answer, I've recently found while using his system, that the Nexus 7.1 was returning <code>false</code> for all three methods - No <code>which</code> command, no <code>test-keys</code> and <code>SuperSU</code> was not installed in <code>/system/app</code>.</p>

<p>I added this:</p>

<pre><code>public static boolean checkRootMethod4(Context context) {
    return isPackageInstalled(""eu.chainfire.supersu"", context);     
}

private static boolean isPackageInstalled(String packagename, Context context) {
    PackageManager pm = context.getPackageManager();
    try {
        pm.getPackageInfo(packagename, PackageManager.GET_ACTIVITIES);
        return true;
    } catch (NameNotFoundException e) {
        return false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is slightly <em>less</em> useful in some situations (if you need guaranteed root access) as it's completely possible for SuperSU to be installed on devices which don't have SU access.</p>

<p>However, since it's possible to have SuperSU installed and working but <strong>not</strong> in the <code>/system/app</code> directory, this extra case will root (haha) out such cases.</p>
