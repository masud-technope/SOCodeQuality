<p>I was facing the same problem, unable to create directory on Galaxy S but was able to create it successfully on Nexus and Samsung Droid. How I fixed it was by adding following line of code:</p>

<pre><code>File dir = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath()+""/""+getPackageName()+""/"");
dir.mkdirs();
</code></pre>
