<pre><code>Uri uri = Uri.parse(""content://sms"");

ContentResolver contentResolver = getContentResolver();

Cursor cursor = contentResolver.query(uri, null, null, null,
  null);



while (cursor.moveToNext()) {

 long thread_id = cursor.getLong(1);
 Uri thread = Uri.parse(""content://sms/conversations/""
   + thread_id);
 getContentResolver().delete(thread, null, null);
}
