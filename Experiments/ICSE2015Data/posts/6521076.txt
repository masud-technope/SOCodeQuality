<p>If you're calling this outside of an Activity, you'll need to pass the context in (or get it through some other call).  Then use that to get your display metrics:</p>

<pre><code>DisplayMetrics metrics = context.getResources().getDisplayMetrics();
int width = metrics.widthPixels;
int height = metrics.heightPixels;
</code></pre>
