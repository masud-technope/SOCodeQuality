<p>In your code add this line</p>

<pre><code>requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);  
</code></pre>

<p>Or in XML use a theme</p>

<pre><code>android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar""
</code></pre>

<p>XML would be a better implementation as with the code version the title bar gets created and then removed which is a waste of resource</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ok good try but it is not working. I
  get:
  android.view.WindowManager$BadTokenException:
  Unable to add window -- token null is
  not for an application if I want to
  shwo the dialog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Change the alert dialog type to system dialog ( e.g., TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY ) and see if this resolves your issue</p>
