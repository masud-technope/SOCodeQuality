<p>I do not see a related method for that attribute in the EditText
class.  However, there are other similar things you could use such as
<code>android:focus/setFocusable(boolean)</code> or create another TextView whose
<code>android:editable=""false""</code> and use <code>setVisiblilty()</code> to switch between the
editable and not editable views.  If you use <code>View.GONE</code> the user will
never know there are two EditTexts.</p>

<p>If your feeling ambitious you could probably do something with the EditText's <code>onTextChanged</code> listener like having it react with a <code>setText</code>.</p>
