<p>This isn't exactly the answer, but it's a solution that is similar. It may help people who were in the same boat as I was.</p>

<p>My image, an application logo, had a transparent background, and I was applying an XML gradient as the image background. I added the necessary padding/margins to the imageView in XML, then added this as my background:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
</code></pre>



<p></p>

<pre><code>&lt;item&gt;

    &lt;shape&gt;

        &lt;gradient
            android:type=""linear""
            android:startColor=""@color/app_color_light_background""
            android:endColor=""@color/app_color_disabled""
            android:angle=""90""
        /&gt;

        &lt;!-- Round the top corners. --&gt;
        &lt;corners
            android:topLeftRadius=""@dimen/radius_small""
            android:topRightRadius=""@dimen/radius_small""
        /&gt;

    &lt;/shape&gt;

&lt;/item&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>
