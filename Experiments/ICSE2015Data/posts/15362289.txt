<p>I don't know if this question is still actual, but in my case, when I switched from Dialog to DialogFragment,</p>

<pre><code>requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);
</code></pre>

<p>was not an option, but I could use</p>

<pre><code>setStyle(STYLE_NO_TITLE, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>instead with the same result.</p>
