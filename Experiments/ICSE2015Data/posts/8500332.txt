<p>Put your splash screen in a separate activity and use <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#startActivityForResult%28android.content.Intent,%20int%29"" rel=""nofollow""><code>startActivityForResult</code></a> from your main activity's <code>onCreate</code> method to display it. This works because, according to the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a special case, if you call startActivityForResult() with a requestCode >= 0 during the initial onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)/onResume() of your activity, then your window will not be displayed until a result is returned back from the started activity. This is to avoid visible flickering when redirecting to another activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should probably do this only if the argument to <code>onCreate</code> is <code>null</code> (indicating a fresh launch of your activity, as opposed to a restart due to a configuration change).</p>
