<p>Take a look at <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_frm/thread/17210d784766602d/d430c900a9c4019c?"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> discussion which handles manually hiding and showing the IME. However, my feeling is that if a focused <code>EditText</code> is not bringing the IME up it is because you are calling <code>AlertDialog.show()</code> in your <code>OnCreate()</code> or some other method which is evoked before the screen is actually presented. Moving it to <code>OnPostResume()</code> should fix it in that case I believe.</p>
