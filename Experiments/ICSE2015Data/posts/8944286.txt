<p>If you already have the package name you wish to activate, you can use the following code which is a bit more generic:</p>

<pre><code>PackageManager pm = context.getPackageManager();
Intent appStartIntent = pm.getLaunchIntentForPackage(appPackageName);
if (null != appStartIntent)
{
    context.startActivity(appStartIntent);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I found that it works better for cases where the main activity was not found by the regular method of start the MAIN activity.</p>
