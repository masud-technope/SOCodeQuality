<p>I still do not know why, but in my scenario, getCheckedItemPositions() returns false values for all items. I cannot see a way to use the methods on the ListView to get the boolean values out. The SparseBooleanArray object seems to have no real-world data in it. I suspect this may be because of some quirk of my implementation, perhaps that I've subclassed ArrayAdapter. It's frustrating, issues like this are a real time-drain.</p>

<p>Anyway, the solution I have used is to to attach a handler to each Checkbox individually as ListView rows are created. So from ListView.getView() I call this method:</p>

<pre><code>private void addClickHandlerToCheckBox(CheckBox checkbox)
{
    checkbox.setOnCheckedChangeListener(new OnCheckedChangeListener() {
    public void onCheckedChanged(CompoundButton arg0, boolean arg1) {
        CheckBox checkbox = (CheckBox)arg0; 
        boolean isChecked = checkbox.isChecked();
        // Store the boolean value somewhere durable
    }
      }
);
</code></pre>
