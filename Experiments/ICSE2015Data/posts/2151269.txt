<p>The InputMethodManager has information about the soft keyboard.  You get it from an activity via:</p>

<pre><code>((InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE))
</code></pre>

<p>You might play around with that to see what it can tell you.  You can use it to show or hide the soft input...</p>
