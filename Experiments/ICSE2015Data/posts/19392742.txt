<p>This is a common problem on Android that has been solved in many ways by many people.  In my opinion the best solution I've seen is the relatively new library called <a href=""http://square.github.io/picasso/"">Picasso</a>.  Here are the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open source, but headed up by <code>Jake Wharton</code> of <a href=""http://actionbarsherlock.com/"">ActionBarSherlock</a> fame.</li>
<li>Asynchronously load images from network or app resources with one line of code</li>
<li>Automatic <code>ListView</code> detection</li>
<li>Automatic disk and memory caching</li>
<li>Can do custom transformations</li>
<li>Lots of configurable options</li>
<li>Super simple API</li>
<li>Frequently updated</li>
</ul>
