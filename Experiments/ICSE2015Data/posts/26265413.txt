<p>I wanted to do something similar. But getting the text value from edit text and comparing it like <code>(str=="""")</code> wasn't working for me. So better option was:</p>

<pre><code>EditText eText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.etext);

if (etext.getText().length() == 0)
{//do what you want }
</code></pre>

<p>Worked like a charm.</p>
