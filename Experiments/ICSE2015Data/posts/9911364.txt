<p>You can override onViewCreated() which is called right after all views had been inflated. It's the right place to fill in your Fragment's member <code>View</code> variables. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>class GalleryFragment extends Fragment {
    private Gallery gallery;

    (...)

    @Override
    public void onViewCreated(View view, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        view.findViewById(R.id.gallery);
        gallery.setAdapter(adapter);
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState);
    }
}
</code></pre>
