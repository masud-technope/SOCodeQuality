<p>None of the answers above worked for me, but I did come up with a horribly ugly workaround that solved the problem. I added a very small, 1x1 pixel image to my project as a resource, and loaded it into my ImageView before calling into garbage collection. I think it might be that the ImageView was not releasing the Bitmap, so GC never picked it up. It's ugly, but it seems to be working for now.</p>

<pre><code>if (bitmap != null)
{
  bitmap.recycle();
  bitmap = null;
}
if (imageView != null)
{
  imageView.setImageResource(R.drawable.tiny); // This is my 1x1 png.
}
System.gc();

imageView.setImageBitmap(...); // Do whatever you need to do to load the image you want.
</code></pre>
