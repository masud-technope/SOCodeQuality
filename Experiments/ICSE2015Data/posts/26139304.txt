<p>If you're attempting to start a SERVICE rather than activity, this worked for me:</p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.setClassName(""com.example.otherapplication"", ""com.example.otherapplication.ServiceName"");
context.startService(intent);
</code></pre>

<p>If you use the intent.setComponent(...) method as mentioned in other answers, you may get an ""Implicit intents with startService are not safe"" warning.</p>
