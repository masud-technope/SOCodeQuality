<p>I realise this is an old question, but the prevailing answer leaves something to be desired.</p>

<p>The question is not clear what is required of <code>imageView</code> - are we passing it back as the view, or merely saving a reference for later?</p>

<p>Either way, if the <code>ImageView</code> is coming from the inflated layout, the correct way to do this would be:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestClass extends Fragment {
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        View v = inflater.inflate(R.layout.testclassfragment, container, false);
        ImageView imageView = (ImageView)v.findViewById(R.id.my_image);
        return v;
    }
}
</code></pre>
