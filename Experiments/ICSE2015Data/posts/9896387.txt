<p>I've spent the entire day testing these solutions and the only thing that worked for me is the above approaches for getting the image and manually calling the GC, which I know is not supposed to be necessary, but it is the only thing that worked when I put my app under heavy load testing switching between activities.  My app has a list of thumbnail images in a listview in (lets say activity A) and when you click on one of those images it takes you to another activity (lets say activity B) that shows a main image for that item.  When I would switch back and forth between the two activities, I would eventually get the OOM error and the app would force close.  </p>

<p>When I would get half way down the listview it would crash.</p>

<p>Now when I implement the following in activity B, I can go through the entire listview with no issue and keep going and going and going...and its plenty fast.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onDestroy()
{   
    Cleanup();
    super.onDestroy();
}

private void Cleanup()
{    
    bitmap.recycle();
    System.gc();
    Runtime.getRuntime().gc();  
}
</code></pre>
