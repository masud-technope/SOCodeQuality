<pre><code>DisplayMetrics dm = getResources().getDisplayMetrics();
float fwidth = dm.density * dm.widthPixels;
float fheight = dm.density * dm.heightPixels;
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>getSize</code> gets you an error due to your minSDKVersion and you don't want to use deprecated methods (<code>getWidth</code> &amp; <code>getHeight</code>), the <code>getMetrics</code> solution was originally posted on 2011 by Balaji.K... And Nik added a comment explaining <code>getDisplayMetrics</code> also considers the status bar size.</p>

<p>Some other comments refer to multiply by the scale (<strong>density</strong>) in order to get the precise float value of the dimensions. Tested in Android v2.2 (API 8) and v4.0 with good results and <strong>no errors/warnings</strong>.</p>
