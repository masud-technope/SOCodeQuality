<p>When <code>PhoneStateListener</code> is used, one need to make sure <code>PHONE_STATE_IDLE</code> following a <code>PHONE_STATE_OFFHOOK</code> is used to trigger the action to be done after the call. If the trigger happens upon seeing <code>PHONE_STATE_IDLE</code>, you will end up doing it before the call. Because you will see the state change <code>PHONE_STATE_IDLE -&gt; PHONE_STATE_OFFHOOK -&gt; PHONE_STATE_IDLE.</code></p>
