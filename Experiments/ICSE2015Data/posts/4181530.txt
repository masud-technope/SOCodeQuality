<pre><code>    Intent videoClient = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
    videoClient.setData(Uri.parse(""http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=""+videoId));
    startActivityForResult(videoClient, 1234);
</code></pre>

<p>where videoId is the video id of the youtube video that has to be played. This code works fine on Motorola Milestone.</p>

<p>But basically what we can do is to check for what activity is loaded when you start the Youtube app and accordingly substitute for the packageName and the className.</p>
