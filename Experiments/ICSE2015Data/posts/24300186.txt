<p>Using my library at <a href=""http://www.github.com/vaibhavpandeyvpz/rootbox"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Go to github project"">rootbox</a>, it is pretty easy. Check the required code below:</p>

<pre><code>    //Pass true to &lt;Shell&gt;.start(...) call to run as superuser
    Shell shell = null;
    try {
            shell = Shell.start(true);
    } catch (IOException exception) {
            exception.printStackTrace();
    }
    if (shell == null)
            // We failed to execute su binary
            return;
    if (shell.isRoot()) {
            // Verified running as uid 0 (root), can continue with commands
            ...
    } else
            throw Exception(""Unable to gain root access. Make sure you pressed Allow/Grant in superuser prompt."");
</code></pre>
