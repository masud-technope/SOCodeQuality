<p>It is possible to find where any additional SD cards are mounted by reading <code>/proc/mounts</code> (standard Linux file) and cross-checking against <a href=""http://vold.sourceforge.net/"">vold</a> data (<code>/system/etc/vold.conf</code>). And note, that the location returned by <code>Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()</code> may not appear in vold configuration (in some devices it's internal storage that cannot be unmounted), but still has to be included in the list. However we didn't find a good way to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8151779/find-sd-card-volume-label-on-android"">describe them to the user</a>.</p>
