<p>Indeed it is interesting question and so far nobody has deserved award. I use the following code:</p>

<pre><code>  boolean isRooted() {
      try {
                ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket(81);
                ss.close();
                                    return true;
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // not sure
            }
    return false;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>The code is certainly not bulletproof, because network can be not available so you get an exception. If this method returns true then 99% you can be sure, otherwise just 50% that not. Networking permission can also spoil the solution.</p>
