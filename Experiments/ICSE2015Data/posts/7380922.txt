<p>Actually I add to the xml layout file anything that could be used! Then from the source code of the specific Activity I get the object by its id and I ""play"" with the visibility method.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p><code>((Spinner)findViewById(R.id.email_spinner)).setVisibility(View.GONE);</code></p>
