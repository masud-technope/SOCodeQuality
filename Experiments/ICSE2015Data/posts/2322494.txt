<pre><code>TelephonyManager tManager = (TelephonyManager)myActivity.getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);
String uid = tManager.getDeviceId();
</code></pre>

<p>getSystemService is a method from the Activity class.  getDeviceID() will return the MDN or MEID of the device depending on which radio the phone uses (GSM or CDMA).  </p>

<p>Each device MUST return a unique value here (assuming it's a phone).  This should work for any Android device with a sim slot or CDMA radio.  You're on your own with that Android powered microwave ;-)</p>
