<p>For the use-case given here we may simply make use of the <code>stopService()</code> method's return value. It returns <code>true</code> if there exists the specified service and it is killed. Else it returns <code>false</code>. So you may restart the service if the result is <code>false</code> else it is assured that the current service has been stopped. :) It would be better if you have a look at <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#stopService%28android.content.Intent%29"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>.</p>
