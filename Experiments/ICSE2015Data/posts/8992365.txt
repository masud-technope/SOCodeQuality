<p>Believe or not my problem with Soft Keyboard was resolved when I discovered that the Activities animations can disable the Soft Keyboard. When you call the intent with the </p>

<pre><code>i.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION);
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>overridePendingTransition(0, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>It can hide the Soft Keyboard and there isn't a way to show it.</p>
