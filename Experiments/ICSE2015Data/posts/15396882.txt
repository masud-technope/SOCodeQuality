<p>For my case, I was using the a SearchView in the actionbar. After a user performs a search, the keyboard would pop open again.</p>

<p>Using the InputMethodManager did not close the keyboard. I had to clearFocus and set the focusable of the search view to false:</p>

<pre><code>        mSearchView.clearFocus();
        mSearchView.setFocusable(false);
</code></pre>
