<p>@alistair Yeah, I think I actually agree with you. Making those objects <strong><code>static</code></strong> is the better workaround if it's simply impractical to keep invoking <code>putExtra()</code> for every property you'd like to pass on. For example, right now, I want to pass an <code>ArrayList</code> that contains objects. I might as well make my ArrayList <strong><code>static</code></strong> instead.</p>
