<p>For situations where you know you will be passing data within an application, use ""globals"" (like static Classes)</p>

<p><a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/235b3063a1656cf2/19afa9c47cc5bbd8"">Here</a> is what <a href=""https://plus.google.com/105051985738280261832/about"">Dianne Hackborn</a> (hackbod - a Google Android Software Engineer) had to say on the matter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For situations where you know the activities are running in the same
  process, you can just share data through globals.  For example, you
  could have a global <code>HashMap&lt;String, WeakReference&lt;MyInterpreterState&gt;&gt;</code>
  and when you make a new MyInterpreterState come up with a unique name
  for it and put it in the hash map; to send that state to another
  activity, simply put the unique name into the hash map and when the
  second activity is started it can retrieve the MyInterpreterState from
  the hash map with the name it receives.</p>
