<p>I don't have enough points to comment on an answer, but I wanted to say that mikec's answer worked for me except that I had to change it to return !isScrollable like so:</p>

<pre><code>mScroller.setOnTouchListener(new OnTouchListener() {
    @Override
    public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
      return !isScrollable;
    }
});
</code></pre>
