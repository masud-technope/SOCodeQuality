<p>For some reason the android.text.LoginFilter class's constructor is package-scoped, so you can't directly extend it (even though it would be identical to this code).  But you can extend LoginFilter.UsernameFilterGeneric!  Then you just have this:</p>

<pre><code>class ABCFilter extends LoginFilter.UsernameFilterGeneric {
    public UsernameFilter() {
        super(false); // false prevents not-allowed characters from being appended
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isAllowed(char c) {
        if ('A' &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'C')
            return true;
        if ('a' &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'c')
            return true;

        return false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't really documented, but it's part of the core lib, and the <a href=""http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.3_r2.1/android/text/LoginFilter.java#LoginFilter.UsernameFilterGeneric"" rel=""nofollow"">source is straightforward</a>.  I've been using it for a while now, so far no problems, though I admit I haven't tried doing anything complex involving spannables.</p>
