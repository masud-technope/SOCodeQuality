<p>Meanwhile I do in general no more use </p>

<pre><code>Bundle savedInstanceState &amp; Co
</code></pre>

<p>the live cycle is for most activities too complicated and not necessary.
And google states itself, it is NOT even reliable.</p>

<p>My way is to save any changes immediately in the preferences</p>

<pre><code> SharedPreferences p;
 p.edit().put(..).commit()
</code></pre>

<p>in some way SharedPreferences work similar like Bundles.
And naturally and at first such values have to be red from preferences.</p>

<p>In the case of complex data you may use Sqlite instead of using preferences.</p>

<p>When applying this concept, the activity just continues to use the last saved state, regardless whether it was an initial open with reboots in between or a reopen due to the back stack.</p>
