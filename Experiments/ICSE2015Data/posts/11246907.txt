<p>Inside PhoneStateListener after seeing the call is finished better use:</p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(CallDispatcherActivity.this, CallDispatcherActivity.class);
intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);
startActivity(intent);
</code></pre>

<p>Where CallDispatcherActivity is the activity where the user has launched a call (to a taxi service dispatcher, in my case). This just removes Android telephony app from the top, the user gets back instead of ugly code I saw here.</p>
