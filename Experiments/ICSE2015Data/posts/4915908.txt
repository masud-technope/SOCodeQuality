<p>I found this thread by having the same problem but I think I have come up with a workaround that worked for me for unkown reasons. Whenever I tried getting a value I got nothing but if I loop through the list setting all to false it started working just like intended.</p>

<p>This was actually a feature I had implemented where the user could either ""Select All"" or ""Unselect All"". I run this method in my onCreate.</p>

<pre><code>private void selectNone() {
    ListView lv = getListView();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; lv.getCount(); i++) {
        lv.setItemChecked(i, false);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now all my values are correct. For getting the values, in my case, just Strings.</p>

<pre><code>private void importSelected() {     
    ListView lv = getListView();
    SparseBooleanArray selectedItems = lv.getCheckedItemPositions();

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; selectedItems.size(); i++) {
        if (selectedItems.get(i)) {
            String item =  lv.getAdapter().getItem(selectedItems.keyAt(i)).toString();
        }
    }

    selectNone(); //Reset
}
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this helps someone.</p>
