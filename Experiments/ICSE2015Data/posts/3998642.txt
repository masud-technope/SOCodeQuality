<p>I remember having an issue with this myself a while back. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3464636/returning-values-from-multiple-selection-listview/3473645"">Here</a> is my previous question, which isn't directly related to your issue, but contains some code that may help. What you might want to try is using <code>checkedPositions.valueAt(int index)</code> rather than <code>checkedPositions.get(int index)</code>. I think that may be what you're actually looking for.</p>
