<p>The other answers that use ConnectivityManager are wrong because having a network connection doesn't mean you have internet access. For example, you might be at a coffee shop with a WiFi captive portal. To actually check yor internet you have to try to connect to an actual server. Normally when you'd want to this you have a specific server in mind that you want to connect to, so go ahead and check if you can connect to that server. Here's a simple method for checking connectivity to a server.</p>

<pre><code>private boolean isOnTheInternet() {
    try {
        URLConnection urlConnection = new URL(""http://yourserver"").openConnection();
        urlConnection.setConnectTimeout(400);
        urlConnection.connect();
        return true;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for setting the ConnectTimeout is that otherwise it defaults to the TCP timeout which can be many seconds long. </p>

<p>Note also that Android won't let you run this on your main thread. </p>
