<p>there is no difference. You should define what you think is the difference, and check for that. Is a galaxy tab a phone? or a tablet? and why?</p>

<p>You should define what specific features you are looking for, and code for that.</p>

<p>It seems you are looking for 'tilt'. I think this is the same as the accelerometer (is that a word?). You can just check if the device supports it, using:</p>

<pre><code>public class Accel extends Activity implements SensorListener {
...
  SensorManager sensorMgr = (SensorManager) getSystemService(SENSOR_SERVICE);
  boolean accelSupported = sensorMgr.registerListener(this,
        SENSOR_ACCELEROMETER,
        SENSOR_DELAY_UI);
...
}
</code></pre>
