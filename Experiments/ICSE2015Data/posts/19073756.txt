<p>I did the following to get acces to all the external sd cards.</p>

<p>With:</p>

<pre><code>File primaryExtSd=Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory();
</code></pre>

<p>you get the path to the primary external SD
Then with:</p>

<pre><code>File parentDir=new File(primaryExtSd.getParent());
</code></pre>

<p>you get the parent dir of the primary external storage, and it is also the parent of all the external sd. 
Now, you can list all the storage and select the one that you want.</p>

<p>Hope it is usefull.</p>
